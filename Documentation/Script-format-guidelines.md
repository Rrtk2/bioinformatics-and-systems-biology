## Script formatting guidelines
Scripts should at least, but not limited by, contain the following items:
- [GENERAL INFORMATION](https://github.com/Rrtk2/bioinformatics-and-systems-biology/blob/master/Script-essentials/GENERAL-INFORMATION.R) 
- [CHECKS](https://github.com/Rrtk2/bioinformatics-and-systems-biology/blob/master/Script-essentials/CHECKS.R) 
- [INSTALL & LOAD PACKAGES](https://github.com/Rrtk2/bioinformatics-and-systems-biology/blob/master/Script-essentials/INSTALL-LOAD-PACKAGES.R) 
- [INPUT](https://github.com/Rrtk2/bioinformatics-and-systems-biology/blob/master/Script-essentials/INPUT.R) 
- MAIN - too diverse to make a standard script for this
- OUTPUT - too diverse to make a standard script for this for now...
- [REMOVE TEMP_ FILES/VARIABLES](https://github.com/Rrtk2/bioinformatics-and-systems-biology/blob/master/Script-essentials/REMOVE%20TEMP_VARS.R) 

## Variable names, constants, functions, settings naming
[varname] can contain letters, numbers and "_"

variable which should not be removed at the end of running the script = [varname]

variable which can be removed at the end of running the script = temp_[varname]

constants = c_[varname]

(custom) functions made within script = f_[varname]

settings = s_[varname]
